<b>CE2007 - Microprocessors</b>

	This module has been revamped by SCSE NTU in AY19/20 with special details toward the Lab sessions to prepare its students better for the Embedded industry. Unlike previous syllabus where labs are surrounded the ARM Cortex M0 processor and emulation of this processor using FPGA, the new lab series are about Cortex M4F processor. Student get to learn about the basics of ARM microprocessors such as instruction set, effecient Embedded C programming,... Do note that this course dwells with the bare-metal implementation of programs on the target architecture, in contrast to CE3003, which deals with RTOS implementation on the same microcontroller platform.
